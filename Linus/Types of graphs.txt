Finite Graph:
A graph that contains a finite number of vertices and edges.

ex:
A     E
 \   /
  C-D
 /
B


Infinite graph_
A graph that has a infinite number of vertices and edges.

ex:
 | | |
-O-O-O-
 | | |
-O-O-O-
 | | |
-O-O-O-
 | | |


Trivial graph:
A graph that contains only one vertex and no edges.

ex:
A


Simple graph:
A graph where there are only one edge between a pair of vertices.

ex:
A-B-C
  \ /
   D

A-B
|X|
C-D


Multi graph
A graph that contains parallel edges, but no loops.
A vertex pair has parallel edges when there are more than one edge connecting a pair of vertices.
A loop is when a vertex has an edge that ends on the same vertex.


Null graph
A graph where there are isolated vertices without any edges

ex:
A	D
   B
      C


Complete graph
A graph where each vertex has n-1 connected to the other vertices, where n = the number of edges.

ex:
A-B
|X|
C-D


Psueado graph
A graph with a loop and some parallel edges


Regular graph
All simple graph can be called regular if all vertices are of equal degree.
All complete graphs are regular graphs, but not all regular graphs are complete graphs.

ex:
geaometrical shapes like squares, triangles, etc.


Bipartite graph:


Labeled graph:
A graph where the edges are labeled with something, be it name, date or weight.
Can also be called a weighted graph.

Digraph graph
